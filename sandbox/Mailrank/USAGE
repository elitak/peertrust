I assume you have the server up and running.

First, try to receive a pop3 mail.
You can do this by using your mailprogramm to send a mail to
the mailaddress (the pop3 mailbox) of the server.
Please use only plaintext mails.
The subject doesn't matter, but the body have to look like this:
setValues:my@email.com:spam@spammer.org:-2.34:43
setEntryByUser:my@email.com

You should then receive a mail with the subject "Your Mailrank results"
and the values in it.
If not, turn on debugging by setting the debug boolean value to true in the MRMail
and look at the output.

Try to use the MRSocket server.
In the perl directory you find among other things getEntry.pl and setEntry.pl.
at the beginning of this two files, you need to set the host and port to connect to:

my $remote_host="123.456.789.087";
my $remote_port=4444;

In most cases the post 4444 should work.
In the Terminal try: ./setEntry my@mail.com spam@spammer.org 123.456 345
if this works, try to receive the entry you just added:
./getEntry my@mail.com
You should see an output.

Thats it for the moment.
