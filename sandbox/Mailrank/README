This is the first version of the Mailrankserver software.
It's written in Java with clients written in Perl.

You need several things to make it run. Please take a look at INSTALL.
I'm not a very good Java programmer. If you have ANY advice or improvement please contact me: brosowski@l3s.de

Thanks,

Marko Brosowski
