Provide authentication and authorization as a service in Edutella. That allows
broadcasting of requests in order to find out if any peer in the network grants
access to the requester. The service also can ask one peer in particular (no
broadcasting). Some examples include:
- Authorization and Authentication in a P2P network based on policies
- Requests asking neighbours (or the whole network) about whether a requester
should be granted access. The policy checks if more than N peers grant access.
