Under the architectural point of view, one of the main features of the <i>Protune</i> system is its mix between
imperative and declarative components. Because of its nature, the <i>Protune</i> system requires functionalities
which can be better implemented according to one of the two programming paradigm; therefore it seemed to
be a quite natural choice implementing these functionalities in the most suitable environment. As a
result the <i>Protune</i> system consists of an imperative and a declarative part: the first one was implemented
(of course) in Java while the second one in Prolog.<br />
In order to handle the communication issues between the two parts the <i>Protune</i> system consists
of, the package <tt>org.protune.api</tt> was developed. The classes it contains
are indeed meant to provide a mapping as straightforward as possible between the imperative
(declarative) part and the declarative (imperative) one.
