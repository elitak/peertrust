In traditional distributed environments, service providers and requesters are usually known to each other. Often shared information in the environment tells which parties can provide what kind of services and which parties are entitled to make use of those services. Thus, trust between parties is a straightforward matter. Even if on some occasions there is a trust issue, as in traditional client-server systems, the question is whether the server should trust the client, and not vice versa. In this case, trust establishment is often handled by unidirectional access control methods, most typically by having the client log in as a pre-registered user.
