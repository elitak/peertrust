\begin{itemize}
	\item The following Java-like code tries to catch the logic of the algorithm: the synchronous protocol, as well as other implementation issues entailed by the choice of Java as a language, is not supposed to be necessarily part of the final solution
	\item Comments are written over the line(s) they refer to
	\item
\begin{verbatim}
Type1[] t1a;
Type2[] t2a=t1a.method();

\end{verbatim}
is a shortcut for
\begin{verbatim}
Type1[] t1a;
Type2[] t2a= new Type2[t1a.length];
for(i=0; i<t1a.length; i++) t2a[i]=t1a[i].method();
