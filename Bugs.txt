ProtuneService does not work if a constructor is specified. Theoretically it should not work if the
constructor is NOT specified.

DispatcherPeer does not support Service constructors with parameters.

PrologEngine interface is out of date (e.g. extractExternalActions actually just extracts unlocked
external actions).

Mapper is almost useless: so far just the following classes use it
   MapperAdapter (of course)
   PrologEngine
   TuPrologWrapper
   FilteredPolicy
   Goal
   Notification
   
PrologEngine: add surrounding information to entities added to the KB and eventually change interface.
