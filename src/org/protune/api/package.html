Under the architectural point of view, one of the main features of the Protune system is its mix between
imperative and declarative components. Because of its nature, the Protune system requires functionalities
which can be better implemented according to one of the two programming paradigm; therefore it seemed to
be a quite natural choice implementing these functionalities in the most suitable environment. As a
result the Protune system consists of an imperative and a declarative part: the first one was implemented
(of course) in Java while the second one in Prolog.<br />
Of course problems arose concerning the communication between the two parts the Protune system consists
of; in order to solve them the package <tt>org.protune.api</tt> was developed. The classes it contains
are indeed meant to provide an as straightforward as possible mapping between the imperative
(declarative) part and the declarative (imperative) one.
