<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>
Package <tt>org.protune.net</tt> provides a number of classes taking care of the issues related with the
communication among nodes of a network. A generic node of a Peer to Peer network is represented by the
interface {@link org.protune.net.Peer}.<br />
This package tries to hide the further complexity requested by the communication among nodes of a
network by providing facilities which should let the programmer to focus on the application. The
application logic is represented by the (abstract) class {@link org.protune.net.Service} which should be
extended by the programmer by incapsulating the application logic in a subclass of it.
</p>

<h3>The network infrastructure</h3>

<p>
In order to grant that communication among nodes actually takes place, it is required that
</p>
<ul>
<li>the information sent by one node is received by the other one</li>
<li>each node is able to understand the information it receives</li>
</ul>
<p>
which means that
</p>
<ul>
<li>each node needs to have a reference (pointer) to the location of the other one</li>
<li>the nodes need to share the same information representation</li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to ensure the previously mentioned requirements are satisfied, package <tt>org.protune.net</tt>
provides the interfaces {@link org.protune.net.Pointer} and {@link org.protune.net.Message}.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one represents the abstraction of a reference to another node. A concrete implementation
can simply exploit socket (as the current one in the Protune system) or whatever more complex means (RPC,
RMI, Web Services ...), as long as the method <tt>sendMessage(Message)</tt> is provided, ensuring that
the information which should be received by the other node is actually sent.</li>
<li>The second one represents the common format of the information the two nodes exchange. Different
applications can implement the interface in different ways.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The <i>Protune</i> system</h3>

<p>
In the <i>Protune</i> system we are mostly interested in negotiations among (pairs of) peers. A
negotiation starts, goes on and finishes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first part the handshaking takes place</li>
<li>In the second part the out-and-out negotiation takes place</li>
<li>In the third part the negotiation finishes and the overall result of the negotiation is provided</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to the various steps of the negotiation, package <tt>org.protune.net</tt> provides the classes
{@link org.protune.net.StartNegotiationMessage}, {@link org.protune.net.OngoingNegotiationMessage} and
{@link org.protune.net.EndNegotiationMessage}, which are all implementation of the interface
{@link org.protune.net.NegotiationMessage}. The concept of "negotiation result" is provided by the
interface {@link org.protune.net.NegotiationResult}; so far this interface is implemented by the classes
{@link org.protune.net.SuccessfulNegotiationResult} and {@link
org.protune.net.UnsuccessfulNegotiationResult}. Exensions are possible in the future.
