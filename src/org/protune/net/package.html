Package <tt>org.protune.net</tt> provides a number of classes taking care of the issues related with the
communication among nodes of a network. A generic node of a Peer to Peer network is represented by the
interface {@link org.protune.net.Peer}.<br />
This package tries to hide the further complexity requested by the communication among nodes of a
network by providing facilities which should let the programmer to focus on the application. The
application logic is represented by the (abstract) class {@link org.protune.net.Service}. Theoretically a
programmer should simply incapsulate the logic of her/his application in a subclass of it.
