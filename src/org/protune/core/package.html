Package <tt>org.protune.core</tt> provides the core classes of the Protune system. Class {@link
org.protune.core.ProtuneService} is a good starting point for the exploration of this package, since
almost all other classes of <tt>org.protune.core</tt> are required in order to construct an {@link
org.protune.core.ProtuneService} object.
